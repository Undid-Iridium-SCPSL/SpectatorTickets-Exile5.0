# SpectatorTickets-Exile5.0
SpectatorTickets-Exile5.0.
 Spectator tickets for Exile 5.0+ for Chaos, and NTF.
 
 I would recommend picking up Ver 1.1.0.


## Deposition
This plugin is an updated version of other potential plugins for spectator tickets using EXILE 3.0. Bottom right corner, non-configurable at this time. ~~ince the update has limitations from previous version, but has become a cororotine operation, awaits and async are used. This is potentially not thread safe, but banks on the fact C# bools are mostly thread safe.~~ Utilizes the fact all calls are cororutines. Furthermore, as of 10-30 utilizes switch that allows you to run a hijacking game component OR utilize the existing coroutines. Thanks
